# FlowControlIndex (FCI)

> Code formatting, under control.  
> Dynamic overflow indexing, fixed-length layout.  

---

## üß≠ What is this?

You want fixed-length codes.  
You want them to overflow gracefully.  
You want them fast.  
This does that.

Supports numeric to alphanumeric overflow like:
```
‚Ä¶ ‚Üí 998
999 ‚Üí A00
A99 ‚Üí Z99
Z99 ‚Üí ZA0
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Radix-based indexing (e.g., base 10, 16, 32, etc.)
- Human-readable mode (skips 'O', 'I')
- Fully dynamic code overflow handling
- Consistent fixed-width format
- Microsecond-level performance

## ‚ú® Example

```java
FlowControlIndex fci = FlowControlIndex.ofBase(10, true);
System.out.println(fci.formatIndex(999, 3));  // A00
System.out.println(fci.formatIndex(2599, 3)); // ZA0
